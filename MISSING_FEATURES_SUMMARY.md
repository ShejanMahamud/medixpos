### 1. Database Backup & Restore System ⚡ HIGHEST PRIORITY

**Status:** ❌ Not Implemented  
**Risk Level:** CRITICAL  
**Estimated Effort:** 3-5 days

#### Why Critical?

- Single point of failure (SQLite file)
- No disaster recovery plan
- Data loss if hardware fails
- No protection against file corruption

#### What's Needed:

```
✓ Automated scheduled backups (daily/weekly)
✓ Manual backup on-demand
✓ Backup to external drive/cloud
✓ Restore functionality with validation
✓ Backup encryption
✓ Backup verification
✓ Incremental backups (PRO tier)

```

#### Implementation Priority:

1. **Week 1:** Manual backup/restore
2. **Week 2:** Automated scheduling
3. **Week 3:** Backup encryption
4. **Week 4:** Cloud backup option

#### Recommended Libraries:

- `node-schedule` for scheduling
- `archiver` for zip compression
